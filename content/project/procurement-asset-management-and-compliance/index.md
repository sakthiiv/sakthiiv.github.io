An integration framework for integrating Saas products from procurement and asset management domains with internal domains. This framework served as an anti-corruption layer built to expose ubiquitous contracts to the clients. Communication between the source and destination services are event driven.

<!-- **Client:** Internal -->

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Lead the delivery of the framework, integrations and domain modeling with the established software delivery practices.
- Created and fostered an innovative ecosystem to develop solutions with the goal to streamline the stakeholder needs.
- Lead the merger of Procurement and Asset management teams which were operating as independent delivery teams. 
- The successful merger resulted in a unified road map with frictionless planning and releases.
